# Early AP Scores
Python application that gets AP Scores from CollegeBoard. 

Written using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), [lxml](http://lxml.de/), and [RoboBrowser](https://github.com/jmcarp/robobrowser).

### Usage

For now, you can access all your scores at [http://collegeboard.org](http://collegeboard.org), but check back next July for a link you can use to see your scores early.

Or, deploy it yourself in a region that recieves AP scores first, and get your scores wherever you are.

### TODO
- Separate scores by year.
- Get AB Subscore for AP Calculus BC Test.
- List AP Awards by year.

Feel free to contribute! Add one of the features above or one of your own invention.
